# Nepal Premier League Data Scraping

# Overview
As a passionate cricket fan, I’ve combined my love for the game and technical skills to create a dataset from the Nepal Premier League (NPL). This project automates the extraction of match details, including team names, match results, and key metrics, and stores the information in a CSV format for further analysis.

Extracts information such as:
Match date and time.
Teams involved (Team 1 and Team 2).
Winning team and margin.
Venue and match format.
Stores all extracted data in a CSV file (Nepal_Premier_League.csv) for easy accessibility.

# Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Selenium: For web scraping dynamic web pages.
Pandas: For data manipulation and CSV handling.
